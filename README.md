* Each assignment should be submitted as a single file in your GitHub repo
* This readme should be contained in your main top folder of your repo
* Any questions should be posted as issues in your repo
* I should have shared access with that repo
* We'll start with an introduction to C and then I'll add new "lessons" each time you complete a old one
* If you need an analogous example to a C problem, say in Python for context, I can provide that for you should you create a GitHub issue and @mention me
* These lessons will be on the GitHub Enterprise instance for Coinbase, and can later be cloned and posted to your personal if you like
